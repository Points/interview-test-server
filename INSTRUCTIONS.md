# Tax Calculator Assignment

Your task is to build an application that queries our mock API and
calculates the total income tax for a given salary and tax year.
You may refer to this resource for context [on how to calculate total income tax](https://investinganswers.com/dictionary/m/marginal-tax-rate#:~:text=To%20calculate%20marginal%20tax%20rate) using marginal tax rates.

Please [see the official reference to tax brackets](https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/financial-toolkit/taxes/taxes-2/5.html) and rates for more information.

## What we're looking for

The assessment is aimed at helping provide us with a picture of 
your approach to development as it relates to:

* Design patterns/programming paradigm
* Scalability
* API interface design
* Frameworks
* Documentation
* Clean code
* UI
* Testing
* Automated testing
* Error handling
* Logging
* Readability

### For backend candidates

The application you’re building should have an HTTP API with an endpoint that
takes an annual income and the tax year as parameters. The appropriate type of
params (query vs body param vs URL etc.) is to be determined by you. Your
endpoint should return a JSON object with the result of the calculation.

### For frontend candidates

The application should have a very basic UI with a form that accepts two
inputs: annual income and the tax year. On form submission, the UI should
print either an error or the total income tax for the inputted parameters.
Feel free to use the frontend application framework that you&apos;re most comfortable with.

### In both cases, it should:

#### Accomplish the following:

* Fetch the tax rates by year i.e. 
  [/tax-calculator/tax-year/[2019|2020|2021|2022]](/tax-calculator/tax-year/2022)
* Receives a yearly salary
* Calculate and displays the total taxes owed for the salary
* Display the amount of taxes owed per band
* Display the effective rate

#### Apply to the following 2022 tax year scenarios:

| Salary      | Total Taxes |
|-------------|-------------|
| $0 <=       | $0          |
| $50,000     | $7,500.00   |
| $100,000    | $17,739.17  |
| $1,234,567  | $385,587.65 |

### Sample Request

Please find a sample request at [/tax-calculator/](http://localhost:5000/tax-calculator/), 
which contains a reliable API endpoint and can be used for test and development purposes. 
It returns the following JSON response: 


```json
{
  "tax_brackets": [
    {
        "min": 0,
        "max": 50197,
        "rate": 0.15
    },
    {
        "min": 50197,
        "max": 100392,
        "rate": 0.205
    },
    {
        "min": 100392,
        "max": 155625,
        "rate": 0.26
    },
    {
        "min": 155625,
        "max": 221708,
        "rate": 0.29
    },
    {
        "min": 221708,
        "rate": 0.33
    }
  ]
}

```


### Please Note

Be aware that we’ve baked in two errors in our mock API — you may handle
them and anything else you see fit to handle accordingly:

* only years 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 are supported
* the API throws errors randomly

These occur on the [/tax-calculator/tax-year/2022](/tax-calculator/tax-year/2022) 
endpoint, which your assignment will be evaluated against.

##  IMPORTANT

Design the application as you would a production app that you and
your team are collaborating on. Your result should not be a proof
of concept and should focus more on the assessment criteria listed
below than on working code.

## Results submission

You can either submit your code as a zip file or send a link to a 
personal repository. Do not fork or submit pull requests to this 
repository.
Please be prepared to provide a walkthrough of your solution during the first 45 mins of the technical panel interview.

## Timeframe

We respect your time and understand that you may have other commitments. As such, 
our assignment is designed to be completed in 4 hours or less. Please try to timebox your effort.
