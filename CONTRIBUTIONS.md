If you'd like to contribute, please submit a Pull Request to this repo.

## New Assignments

For new assignments, please add a new folder under [api](https://github.com/Points/interview-test-server/tree/master/api) and keep the work isolated to there. If you wish to make improvements outside of the scope of your assignment, please submit them under another Pull Request.

You can link the routes to your assignment at the bottom of [app.py](https://github.com/Points/interview-test-server/blob/master/app.py#L37).

## Local Development

If you'd like to run it locally for development purposes, it runs like a typical flask app:

```python
export FLASK_APP=app:app
flask run [--reload]
# navigate to 127.0.0.1:5000
```
